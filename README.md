# Flyme-Charging-Battery
A dive into paper.js

A small project made to fill a request for the iOS jailbreak community.

Inspired by a reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3o94pn/upcoming_i_saw_the_request_for_the_charging/

Which was, originally, inspired by the charging screen of Meizu Flyme OS.
